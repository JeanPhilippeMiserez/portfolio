    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In the health care industry, doctors often work in cooperation to provide the best possible care to patients. When a patient needs specialized care, their primary care doctor will refer them to a specialist. The referral network between doctors plays a crucial role in ensuring that patients receive the appropriate care and treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be working with **two datasets**: \n",
    "- one containing **doctor profile information**, and \n",
    "- one containing **referral information between pairs of doctors**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to use Pandas and Numpy to manipulate the data and answer questions. In summary, it involves to apply some basic data manipulation operations, combine the information from these two datasets, extract the bipartite graph from the referral network consisting of primary care doctors and specialists, and perform descriptive analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the literature, analyzing the referral mechanism in health care can lead to a better understanding of patient outcomes, provider performance, and cost-effectiveness, which can be applied to other areas of healthcare or other industries as well. Think about how to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, identify trends and patterns, and make data-driven decisions that can improve efficiency and effectiveness within a business or organization.

    "The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a unique identification number assigned to health care providers by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in the United States. The NPI allows health care providers to be \n",
    "identified and tracked in a standardized way across the health care industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the NPI, doctors have specialties specified in the taxonomy code, which indicate the area of medicine they specialize in. Doctors also have a practice location, which includes their address, city, state, and postal code. This information is contained in the first dataset **```npidata_US_statecode.csv```**. The dataset is downloaded from the website [NPI files](https://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPI_Files.html) and more description can be found in [Data Dissemination – Code Values (NPPES)](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand/Downloads/Data_Dissemination_File-Code_Values.pdf). The column names and descriptions of this dataset are listed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```NPI```: National Provider Identifier, a unique identification number assigned to healthcare providers in the United States.\n",
    "- ```Provider Gender Code```: Gender of the healthcare provider.\n",
    "- ```Certification Date```: The date when the healthcare provider received certification in their field of practice.\n",
    "- ```Provider Enumeration Date```: The date when the healthcare provider was assigned their NPI.\n",
    "- ```Entity Type Code```: The type of healthcare entity associated with the provider, such as an individual (Entity Type Code = 1) or organization (Entity Type Code = 2).\n",
    "- ```Provider Last Name (Legal Name)```: The last name of the healthcare provider as registered with the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES).\n",
    "- ```Provider First Name```: The first name of the healthcare provider as registered with the NPPES.\n",
    "- ```Provider First Line Business Practice Location Address```: The first line of the healthcare provider's practice address.\n",
    "- ```Provider Business Practice Location Address Postal Code```: The zip code of the healthcare provider's practice location.\n",
    "- ```Provider Business Practice Location Address State Name```: The state in which the healthcare provider's practice is located.\n",
    "- ```Provider Business Practice Location Address City Name```: The city in which the healthcare provider's practice is located.\n",
    "- ```Provider License Number State Code_1```: The state code for the healthcare provider's license.\n",
    "- ```Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code_1```: The taxonomy code for the healthcare provider's specialty.\n",
    "- ```Provider License Number_1```: The healthcare provider's license number.\n",
    "- ```Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Group_1```: The group of taxonomy codes to which the healthcare provider's taxonomy code belongs.\n",
    "- ```Is Sole Proprietor```: A indicator of whether the healthcare provider is a sole proprietor.\n",
